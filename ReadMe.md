##  Guess the Letters Game

This project is a simple "Guess the Letters" game implemented in Python. The game randomly selects a word and the player has to guess each letter of the word within a limited number of attempts.

# How to Run

git clone https://github.com/your-username/hangman.git
cd hangman

# Install the required dependencies  if any

    pip install -r requirements.txt


# Run the Game:

python hangman.py

# Game Instructions:

After starting the game, you will see a series of underscores representing the hidden word. Each underscore corresponds to a letter in the word.
- You will be prompted to guess a letter.
- Enter a letter and press Enter.
- If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed in its correct position.
- If the letter is not in the word, you will lose one guess. The number of remaining guesses will be displayed.
- Continue guessing letters until you either:
Guess all the letters in the word correctly (win), or Run out of guesses (lose).
